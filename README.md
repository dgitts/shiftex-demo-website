# Applight Demo Website

This repository contains the **Applight Demo Website**, a project by **Shiftex Industries** to demonstrate industry-standard web development workflows. Applight showcases the power of version control and CI/CD pipelines, emphasizing how businesses can streamline development and achieve their web goals effectively.

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Applight** serves as a practical example of:
- Managing **staging** and **production** environments for secure and efficient development.
- Leveraging **Git branching strategies** to separate development (`develop` branch) and production-ready code (`main` branch).
- Automating testing and deployments through CI/CD pipelines.

The project demonstrates how these tools and practices can improve reliability, collaboration, and scalability for clients.

## 🌐 Environment Details

- **Staging URL**: [staging.shiftex-demos.com](https://staging.shiftex-demos.com)
  - Used to test new features and updates before production deployment.
- **Production URL**: [production.shiftex-demos.com](https://production.shiftex-demos.com)
  - Represents the live, production-ready version of the Applight website.

## 🚀 Features

- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Automatically builds, tests, and deploys changes pushed to `develop` and `main` branches.
- **Modern Web Stack**:
  - Built using scalable, performance-focused technologies (e.g., React, Laravel, Docker).
- **Secure Deployment**:
  - Isolated environments for staging and production to enhance security and ensure consistency.

## 🔧 Workflow Overview

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - **`develop`**: For testing and staging deployments.
   - **`main`**: For production-ready deployments.
2. **Automated Deployments**:
   - Pushing to `develop` triggers a pipeline to deploy to [staging.shiftex-demos.com](https://staging.shiftex-demos.com).
   - Pushing to `main` triggers a pipeline to deploy to [production.shiftex-demos.com](https://production.shiftex-demos.com).
3. **Pipeline Benefits**:
   - Reduces manual errors.
   - Ensures consistency across environments.
   - Speeds up deployment processes.
